This is the GitHub organisation page for the [Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR)](https://www.scar.org/). Members of the SCAR community wishing to make use of this space should note the following guidelines:

**PLEASE NOTE:** these guidelines are currently in draft form and may change. Comments on the guidelines are welcome and [may be made via the issues page](https://github.com/SCAR/Organisation-Guidelines/issues).

1. Use of this organisation is limited to products and projects that have official SCAR endorsement.

1. The README of each repository should provide a clear description of its purpose, including the SCAR group or project with which the repository is associated.

1. Projects should be of sufficient maturity that their value and usage is clear to the SCAR community. Projects need not be final or polished, but equally should not be largely-empty placeholders for future development. For example, a software package should provide sufficient working functionality that a user can see how it might be used within their research, even if that functionality is subject to ongoing development and change.<br /><br />Projects in very early stages of development should use other spaces (e.g. personal or institutional GitHub accounts) until sufficient maturity has been reached.<br /><br />However, projects that are not yet at this level of maturity will be considered if there are good reasons to host them here.<br /><br />Particular types of projects may have more specific "maturity" requirements &mdash; for example, R packages are encouraged to follow the [rOpenSci packaging guide](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/blob/master/packaging_guide.md).

1. This GitHub space is not intended as a primary means for publication of scientific data. Such data should be published through a National Antarctic Data Centre or other appropriate data repository (see the [SCAR Data Policy](https://www.scar.org/scar_media/documents/scadm/SCAR_39_DataPolicy.pdf)). However, software packages often contain data that are an integral part of the software, or for demonstration purposes. In these cases, please ensure that the data are appropriately cited and/or described by a metadata record.

## Requesting a new repository

To request a new repository, please do so [via the issues page](https://github.com/SCAR/Organisation-Guidelines/issues/new?template=new-repository-request.md) or <a href="mailto:bdanis@ulb.ac.be?subject=SCAR GitHub repo request">by email</a>.

**Intended repository usage**
A brief but clear description of what the repo will be used for.

**The associated SCAR project or group**
Repositories here should be associated with official SCAR activities, through e.g. expert groups, research programs, or other activities. Please give the repository's SCAR association here.

**Project maturity**
Projects hosted here should be of sufficient maturity that their value and usage is clear to the SCAR community. Projects need not be final or polished, but equally should not be largely-empty placeholders for future development. For example, a software package should provide sufficient working functionality that a user can see how it might be used within their research, even if that functionality is subject to ongoing development and change. Please give a brief description of the project maturity here. If the project is not yet at this stage but you believe there is a good case for hosting in the SCAR space, please outline the reasons here.

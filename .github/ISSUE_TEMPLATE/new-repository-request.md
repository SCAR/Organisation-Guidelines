**Intended repository usage**
A brief but clear description of what the repo will be used for.

**The associated SCAR project or group**
Repositories here should be associated with official SCAR activities, through e.g. expert groups, research programs, or other activities. Please give the repository's SCAR association here.

**Project maturity**
Projects hosted here should be of sufficient maturity that members of the SCAR community can use them now. Please confirm that this is the case here. If the project is not yet at this stage but you believe there is a good case for hosting in the SCAR space, please outline the reasons here.
